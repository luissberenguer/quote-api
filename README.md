# quote-api

This is a CodeCademy project. The technologies used are Javascript, Node.js and Express as the framework.
I've used the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods in the Backend, and tested them with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

If you want to use it in your local machine, download the repository and make sure to 
```
npm install 
```
Then, in your terminal run 
```
node server.js
```
And within a browser (like Google Chrome) enter http://localhost:4001
